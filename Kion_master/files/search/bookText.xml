Language Proficiency Document History Transactions: Explanation:
History information comes in order from the most recent date to the farthest date, the latest student status date shows the current status of the student on the Main Enrollment page. In summary, the most recent status is the current status of the student.
History is the information held to monitor student status changes on a Term-by-Term basis. The student must have at least one enrollment per semester. The student's history: in case of enrollment renewal, if the consultant approves it online, the ' Enrollment Renewed' information is automatically added to the relevant period. At the end of the registration period, students who do not register for the course with the ' std07 History Search' application are assigned the ' Registration Not Renewed' record. In other cases, student affairs must manually add status changes to the history with the help of this application. The accuracy of the historical information affects some documents such as 'Military Service Certificate' and statistics. The case of not renewing the registration is important in the student certificate and military service certificate. (Because they can't benefit from student rights)

If there is no university name in the list, it can be written in the blank area under the University section. If this information is entered, it will be shown on the transcript from which university the student came with a lateral transfer or to which university he went with Erasmus.
Student's ' Registration Deletion' or ' Graduation Procedures' are done with the help of this application in a similar way. In this case, the student's 'Graduation/Departure Date' is updated. (See Screen std01- 02)
STD02 Student Registration
Purpose and Scope: It is the application used during the first registration to the university. The last status: 'The one who won the university but has not registered yet' The first registration process for students is provided with the help of this application by completing all the documents and procedures of the student.
Explanation: With this application, the record of registration is added to the student's history information and the first registration date of the student to the university is updated. A similar operation can be performed with the help of ' STD01 Student Search’, but this application has been developed so that the operation can be done faster with a single button. In the same application, it is possible, if needed, for student certificate and military service certificate to be obtained.
During enrollment to the university, if this program is used up to date, the Number of Students Registered in the University can be tracked properly. (From ' STD01 Student Search' or 'RPR01 Quota Report' under the Reports menu)

' ' (blank) means that Student has enrolled online but Advisor has not approved. The student is not enrolled for this course. These courses are not shown on the transcript.
Web -based course registrations (student/advisor approvals) are reflected in real-time on students' courses and class lists.
The ' repeated course ' information in the list is used to indicate that a student’s new course has been taken in place of a course taken previously. This association is done with the ' STD03 Courses Taken by the Student ' application. Aim in general is that it is possible to associate lessons with a particular student, except for the case that the lesson is removed and another lesson is opened in its place. For example, taking another course in place of an elective. As a result of this association, the name of the associated course is shown in parentheses next to the relevant course on the transcript and the second course is not reflected in the credit totals. Below, as an example, the status of failing a course and the course information taken instead are shown.

Explanation: The assignment of information such as 'course code, name, foreign language, ects credit, theoretical, practical, application and credit' is provided with the help of this application. The departments assign the offered courses with the help of course catalog information. They cannot change course information on a departmental basis. The authority to update courses from the course catalog belongs to the departments that use the course catalog. Closing a course in the course catalog does not close the courses under it. The faculty/department and the instructor responsible for the course are for information purposes only.
The courses taken by the students during Erasmus are also assigned in the catalogue, and the status of the courses is selected as 'taken outside the university’. Erasmus courses are also assigned in the 'CRS02 Course ' application. Erasmus courses are assigned to students with the ' STD03 Courses Taken by the Student ' application. Thus, it is ensured that the courses are displayed with their original names in the Transcript and Diploma Supplement.
Through the List function, 'On/Off' or 'All courses' can be searched by 'Course Code' or 'Name'. Course Catalog application filtering section:

Minimum: Represents the minimum number of students who can take the course. It is actively used in the summer school (For cases where the courses chosen by the student below a certain number should not be offered).
Maximum: Represents the maximum number of students who can take the course. If it is left blank or zero, it means that unlimited students can be enrolled in the department.
For the courses assigned as University Common / Departmental Common, the Maximum is invalid, and the Non-Departmental Maximum should be used.
Non-Departmental the Maximum: Except for the department where the course is offered; It represents the maximum number of students who can take the course from other departments. -1 to the non- Departmental field If value is given, it means that no student from outside the department will be able to select the course.
What should not be forgotten here is.
Quotas inside and outside the department are isolated from each other. If maximum number of students is 50, and maximum 10 people from outside the department are assigned for a course, it does not mean that 40 people can take the course from within the department and 10 people from outside the department, it means that 60 people in total can take the course. Therefore, for non-departmental students to receive unlimited, the Non-Departmental Maximum field must be left blank or zero.
Assignment of Quota Breakdown:
When a student selects a course and wants to add it to his list, the quota control procedure is called, respectively.
For its own department (the course may be the course of its own department, or the lower breakdown may be assigned for the department. The lower breakdown is always prioritized.) Is the quota assigned? If so, is there any vacancies?
If the course does not belong to its own department (including the breakdown for the common or other department course, is there a non- departmental quota assigned)? If so, is there any available room?

-1 (course has been added to the list but not yet approved), 1 (advisor approval given),

2, 4 (the advisor's rejection of the course),

-1 (course added to the list but not yet approved),
1 (student consent given),
3 (add-drop approved),
In the above example, the course was opened as ' University Common, but only two faculties were required to take this course. Faculty of Law A total of 145 people will be able to choose, 143 of which will be for the Faculty of Pharmacy. Except for these faculties/departments, no student will be able to take the course. (Because the most non-departmental fields are given as -1) The system primarily looks at it as it is a sub-department based on faculty/department, and it is also considered whether the course is offered commonly by the University/Faculty. If the sub-breaks were not assigned or the Common was not opened, the Maximum and Non-Section Maximum Fields would be active.
In another example above; Most Quote shows 'in-department quota'. Everyone is considered to have taken a common course from outside the department. So, it doesn't matter what is written there, it can be empty. In addition, the values assigned in the sub-breakdown always take precedence. For example, if it were assigned as 50 for the non-departmental section, in addition to the 17 sub-breakdowns in the example, a total of 50 more people could be registered from any department other than these sub- departments. Therefore, as in the screenshot, the non-departmental quota should generally be given as - 1 for the courses with sub-breakdowns assigned.
   ]]></page><page Index="50" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[  Assignment of University Common / Faculty Common Quota:
In the above example, since the course was opened in the Faculty of Engineering as a common course, it means that 50 people, mixed from all departments, will be able to choose this course. Since the lower breakdown is not given and the university common/departmental common is assigned, the students in the engineering faculty will be deemed to have taken this common course from outside the department. Therefore, the Non-Departmental Quota field must be filled.
