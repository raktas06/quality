						<p>SThe System Book is created in a three-dimensional structure. Themes and components (core capabilities and key strategies) change over time. The themes outside the system illustrate the main objectives in any university that has reached global maturity. The system theme, on the other hand, is a basis that needs to be revised relatively, depending on the dynamism of this structure that moves, changes and evolves to achieve these goals. The components of the System Book have characteristics that change over time. Changes in environmental conditions or ways of doing business affect components more quickly in terms of managerial, technological or social aspects. Accelerating the reflection of this interaction on the overall structure and revealing a relatively agile structure is achieved by bringing the components closer to the ideal.</p>
            <p>The System Book consists of chapters separated by four themes (Table 1). The conceptual core formed around the system theme forms the basic architecture of the System Book (Figure 2). Policies integrated into the system theme represent the core, while the outer layer contains three other themes. The interrelationships and interaction between the themes support the structure to remain focused on continuous improvement. It is anticipated that the architecture of the System Book will contribute to the improvement of the system entropy at low levels.</p>
				    <p>System Theme is the management of the university.</p>
				    <p>SIt is concerned with the basic processes of working and coordinating it. Policies include rules or documents for understanding processes at various levels. Research Theme, which is at the top of the priority areas of the Faculty of Business Administration, is related to the creation, development and dissemination of scientific knowledge, which is the main activity for a scientific institution. Global university education is defined by the Education Theme as the second priority area of ​​the UNYT. This theme contains all the information about the educational processes. Creating scientific value for society through scientific activities is the theme of the Society Theme. Social responsibility is implemented with this theme.</p>
            </p>In System Book, there are 4 main layers (strategic level) and 2 auxiliary layers so that themes can be represented at different levels and theme details can be conveyed to the user with a specific semantic template.</p>
